        More than two weeks ago, shortly after I landed, I updated a few of my SocMed accounts with a partial photo of a feature that carried a caption that stated, “Manila welcomed me with coffee and a feature on Manila Bulletin’s Style Weekend &acirc;&quot;&yen; oh yea, and traffic. Great to be back!” It certainly took [...]

        I consider going to a salon, getting a shampoo and a blow dry a luxury. It’s probably one of my favorite luxuries too.&Acirc;&nbsp; I get lazy when it comes to fixing my hair, so having someone do it for me: shampoo + head massage + blow dry to perfection = a must. Where else should [...]

        All in the name of research. Save for the strain the activity would put on my wallet, it’s one of the things I appreciate about what I do. Who can say no to online shopping? And though I can easily pop in at any Sportsgirl store, I’ve been curious on how they go about their [...]

        What started out as a simple FB-messaging-slash-online-window-shopping — a pair of expensive Miu Miu sunglasses, browsing through shopping websites, and general chitchat about needing more boys boots in our lives — turned into an online bargain shopping at wee hours of the morning (my time) to kick start my Australia Day Weekend.

        PAINT. SWEAT. BOOZE. Three things you will have on you as you wrestle your way through thousands of party goers every third Sunday of January. If there’s one local festival my friends and I can’t have without, it’s the annual Sinulog Festival held in Cebu City, the queen city of the south (and home of [...]

        Not that I’d want you folks to take that seriously but, yea, outlook for the clutch for 2013 seems good, seeing that I’ve already managed to acquire quite a few of them and January isn’t even over. Let’s see — I already told you about the Faux Croc Clutch I bought soon after arriving in [...]
