        I consider going to a salon, getting a shampoo and a blow dry a luxury. It’s probably one of my favorite luxuries too.&Acirc;&nbsp; I get lazy when it comes to fixing my hair, so having someone do it for me: shampoo + head massage + blow dry to perfection = a must. Where else should [...]

        Nothing wrong with being ordinary. Or wearing old things, for that matter. These present opportunities for the wheels of our imagination to turn. They can fuel an activity geared towards creativity. Take any normal day, for instance. You know you’ll wake up to a set of activities, thinking them common and, quite possibly, dull — [...]

        Land of Oz, land of 15% percent higher exposure to UV rays. Yeah, I was warned. I’m +/- an hour drive away from several pretty beaches around, so what the heck, right?

       Do you know how to care for dry chapped lips?

        A few weeks prior my trip, I’ve been complaining about dry chapped lips. I noticed that mine has been unusually dry and seriously chapped esp the top lip. I blame the poor intake of a proper amount of liquid, e.g. water, and mostly the weather. What perplexes me is the notion that it’s normally cold [...]

        Two months and a few you-look-better-with-long-hair comments later, I had to pause to consider hairstyle options and I’ve decided to keep my hair short for a little while longer. I’ve already spent quite a number of years with it long, I reckon, sticking with the short hairstyle will do me good. 2-month old hair, photo [...]

        Neutrogena Deep Clean Blackhead Eliminating Daily Scrub and Cooling Toner Truth be told, I approach skincare products with a little skepticism since there hasn’t been any science that can fully rectify or reverse seemingly unpleasant effects of nature or what imbalance we’d notice or go through. However, I do hope on the bit that it [...]

        As a self-confessed lippie addict, it would come as no surprise when I would experiment with a variety of lip makeup from different brands. All eyes on Laura Mercier and their selection of lip glosses which I thought would be a great gift idea for friends last Christmas. Of course, I ended up getting me [...]
