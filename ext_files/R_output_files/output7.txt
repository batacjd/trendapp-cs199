        More than two weeks ago, shortly after I landed, I updated a few of my SocMed accounts with a partial photo of a feature that carried a caption that stated, “Manila welcomed me with coffee and a feature on Manila Bulletin’s Style Weekend &acirc;&quot;&yen; oh yea, and traffic. Great to be back!” It certainly took [...]

        Catapulted back to a time when firsts are fresh and school is cool.

        A provocative, avant-garde twist to a typically mannish military-inspired style with its body contouring form, roughed up with ruching details and silver hardware, add to that the alluring dip of the neckline that can go deeper, zipped down. The modest hem length balances out the sexy, just a couple or so inches above the knee; [...]

        Make all your decisions without fear or favour. Don’t listen to the voice of the masses or to the ingrained belief that you can’t or you shouldn’t. Wouldn’t it be better to ask, “Why not?” Trick is to know how, and how to know. Train your brain to see what works best and never be [...]

        Studs Wedge Black. Shoes. I’m just about ready to accept the fact that I have ZERO room left in my luggage. Though excess ain’t enough to fill up a BB box. Hm.

        Livening things up in the t-shirt and jeans front are two fantastic details in active rotation: Printed Jeans AND Distressed Jeans. Casual and hip, tough and urban. They’re just the right amount of oomph the simple look needs to make the style staple a little more interesting. But you can’t wear them both at the [...]
