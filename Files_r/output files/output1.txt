       CM to unveil their first quad-core device
       
       
       
       
       
      
      
       In recent times, Cherry Mobile has sent an invitation to the members of press and bloggers to attend a launching event that will take place this coming week. But we have a hint that it&acirc;€™s not going to be just an ordinary product launch as suggested by the invite&acirc;€™s slogan &acirc;€œIt&acirc;€™s Time to Go Four Times Faster&acirc;€?.
       
       As you can see, the image doesn&acirc;€™t reveal too much of detail of what exactly Cherry Mobile has in store for us. But from the looks of it, it seems that we may have an upcoming Nexus 7 competitor in our hands.
       Nothing is certain at this point. Fortunately, we have to wait too long until we found out what device we can expect from the local company.

         They should go with 2GB or 3GB to compete with the upcoming 2nd generation of ASUS Google Nexus 7 with 8MP or 13MP Rear Camera and 5MP Front Camera and 1080 HD VIDEO Recording.

           Correction that should be 2GB or 3GB RAM. Can cherry maybe use NVDIA Tegra 4 Processor and Corning Gorilla Glass 3 this time?

         CM has always been known to be a “pang-masa” brand I don’t really expect high end components whatever quad core device they’ll be shelling out in the near future (regardless of our endless wishlist of top notch specs for the perfect phone/tablet).
